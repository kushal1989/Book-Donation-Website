# Book-donation-website-project
## *Introduction:*
**Somaiya Books:** Full stack website which is intended to serve as a platform for K J Somaiya College of Engineering students to donate their old , used books.

This project intends to put old, used books to good use by making them readily available for donation to younger college students.
